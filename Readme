The rpal parser for project1. There is already an excutable program "p1" in this directory. 
--To generate a new one from the beginning,just type "make cl", and then "make" in terminate. 
--Several switches for this program:
	-ast: It will print the AST of given program
	-l  : It will list all the tokens or items in testing program
It will show nothing without switches, and we support multiple switches. That is to say	,if we type something like:
p1 -ast -l /tests/trees, it will not only print the tree, but list all items below.
